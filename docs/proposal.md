## Summary of Project
Our project aims to create an agent vs agent artificial intelligence combat system. This will be implemented by Q-learning, where the agents learn based on past experiences, rather than actual environment information. The environment begins with two agents in a designated arena, where they fight to the death. Each agent will be its own A.I. based on two separate models. We will first use our sanity cases to determine whether the agent is moving and attacking correctly. After these checks are passed, we will spawn our two agents that will be starting with swords to fight. We will also be including the Dragonball mod so the agents have more choices for combat. Our only inputs are the spawned agents in the arena.  The output of this project are the agent's actions until one agent dies.

## Evaluation Plan
Our performance of our project can be measure by three metrics. The first is the remaining health of the living agent. The second is the number of swings of the sword by the "winner". The third is the amount of time combat lasted for. We can use these metrics to determine how well our project has gone so far. A greater remaining health of the living agent could mean that agent was trained better than the other. The lower the number of swings by the "winner" is better because that means the "winner" has been more efficient and accurate. If we look at how long the duel lasts, the shorter the time means that one agent is highly more trained than the other.

To evaluate the agent's performance by having sanity checks. Our first sanity check would be against another non-moving and non-fighting agent to make sure the agent has succesfully recognized another person and that there is successfull combat attacks. The next sanity check would be on a moving and non-fighting agent to see if our agent can follow the other succesfully, and to make sure successful attacks are made. Another sanity check is to have a timer to make sure the agents do not go on forever fighting, and so that we can make sure a correct action is being made. Our moonshot case, would be three or more agents dueling in a battle royale.
