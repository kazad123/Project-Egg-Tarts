## Summary of Project
Our project is agent vs agent artificial intelligence combat. This will work by spawning two agents in a designated arena, and having them fight to the death. The agents will be starting with swords to fight, and we will also be including the Dragonball mod so the agents have more choices for combat. There will be no inputs from the user, so the input of this project is just the agents spawning in the arena. The output of this project are the agent's actions until one agent dies. Each agent will be its own A.I based on two separate models. The goal of this project is to implement Q-learning, where the agents have to learn based on past experiences, rather than information about the environment.

## Evaluation Plan
Our performance of our project can be measure by three metrics. The first is the remaining health of the living agent. The second is the number of swings of the sword by the "winner". The third is the amount of time combat lasted for. We can use these metrics to determine how well our project has gone so far. A greater remaining health of the living agent could mean that agent was trained better than the other. The lower the number of swings by the "winner" is better because that means the "winner" has been more efficient and accurate. If we look at how long the duel lasts, the shorter the time means that one agent is highly more trained than the other.

To evaluate the agent's performance by having sanity checks. Our first sanity check would be against another non-moving and non-fighting agent to make sure the agent has succesfully recognized another person and that there is successfull combat attacks. The next sanity check would be on a moving and non-fighting agent to see if our agent can follow the other succesfully, and to make sure successful attacks are made. Another sanity check is to have a timer to make sure the agents do not go on forever fighting, and so that we can make sure a correct action is being made. Our moonshot case, would be three or more agents dueling in a battle royale.
